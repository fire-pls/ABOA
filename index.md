Welcome to the ABOA homepage. In the navbar you'll find useful links to help you
navigate the site.
<br style="margin-bottom:20px;">
I suggest starting with [categories]({{ site.url }}/ABOA/shop), and from there you
can click on a category to refine your results further.
<br style="margin-bottom:20px;">
If you have an account, you can [sign in]({{ site.url }}/ABOA/user) to view your
[cart]({{ site.url }}/ABOA/cart). If you would like to make an account, you must
sign up on the [API website itself](https://aboa-v1.herokuapp.com/users/sign_up),
and then [re-sign in]({{ site.url }}/ABOA/user) using the [token displayed on this page](https://aboa-v1.herokuapp.com/api/v1/) as your "password".
