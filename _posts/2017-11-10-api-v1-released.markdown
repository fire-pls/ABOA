Thanks for viewing my page. This github page will be dedicated to my A_BOA API,
my very first project after completing Le Wagon Tokyo. It's fragile in the
current release as I've not done extensive testing with production data, but
I hope it will prove of use to some people.

I designed the API with individuals in mind -- entrepreneur-types who want to
list and sell their own brand, or get an idea about how their product might sell.
The name reflects this, ABOA is an acronym for Administrable By One API ;)

Feel free to fork on github and change the code however you please, I know
it's a little messy ^__^;;

ALSO, at the time of writing I don't have anything actually displayed ^__^;;
I'll write another post as soon as the site is functioning proper.
